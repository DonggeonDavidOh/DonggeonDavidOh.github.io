    - "I push the boundaries of safety assurance for intelligent systems. In doing so:"
    - "• I integrate insights from **control theory**, **reinforcement learning (RL)**, and **dynamic game theory** to certify and enforce safety of high-dimensional, black-box systems under uncertainty."
    - "• I investigate the interplay between **humans and robots** in safety-critical scenarios and how to foster **safe**, **smooth**, and **trustworthy** collaboration."
    - "Ultimately, I envision a world where robots operate safely amidst other agents, including humans, in **unstructured, open-world environments**."
