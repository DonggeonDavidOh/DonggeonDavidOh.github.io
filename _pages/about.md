Hi there :) I’m a PhD student in [Princeton ECE](https://ece.princeton.edu/), working with [Prof. Jaime F. Fisac](https://saferobotics.princeton.edu/jaime).

I push the boundaries of **safety assurance for intelligent systems**. In doing so,

- ( **Safety RL** ) I integrate insights from control theory, reinforcement learning (RL), and dynamic game theory to certify and enforce safety of high-dimensional, black-box systems under uncertainty.
- ( **HRI** ) I investigate the interplay between humans and robots in safety-critical scenarios and how to foster safe, smooth, and trustworthy collaboration.

Ultimately, I envision a world where robots operate safely amidst other agents, including humans, in **unstructured, open-world environments**.

Previously, I earned a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering and a B.S. in Artificial Intelligence at Seoul National University, Republic of Korea.
